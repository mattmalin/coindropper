experience_individuals <- read_csv("experience.txt", col_names = c("start_bucket", "end_bucket"))

# for ease of later distribution assumptions, label end buckets 0 to 8 (rather than 1 to 9),
# and add 'mirrored' observations under assumption of symmetry:
experience <- experience_individuals %>% 
  mutate(
    start_bucket = 9 - start_bucket,      # 8 total start buckets, so (8+1-n) to mirror
    end_bucket   = 10 - end_bucket) %>%   # 9 total end buckets, so (9+1-n) to mirror

# Distribution fitting ----------------------------------------------------

# note that binomial distribution has chance of 0, i.e. with size 10 there can be between 0 and 10
# successes, but here there is always a bucket, i.e. 1-9 rather than 0-9, so offset by 1
